# File Type Feature Matrix

Comprehensive mapping of PyChivalry features to CK3 file types and locations.

## Document Overview

This document tracks which LSP features work for which file types/locations. **Section 1 (Fully Validated File Types)** is organized by *file type*—it shows which CK3 content files (events, decisions, story cycles, etc.) have complete schema-driven validation and what validations apply to each. **Section 6.1 (Features by Module)** is organized by *implementation module*—it shows which Python modules provide which features and whether they are schema-driven. In short: Section 1 answers "what gets validated?" while Section 6.1 answers "how is validation implemented?"

Use this as a reference for:
- Understanding current coverage
- Planning feature expansion
- Identifying gaps in validation

- **Schema Examples** - Every schema in `pychivalry/data/schemas/` includes usage examples




### Architecture Philosophy

**What's Declarative:**
1. Field requirements (required/optional per file type)
2. Validation rules (cross-field validations with conditions)
3. Generic rules (universal patterns like effect-in-trigger)
4. Completions (field completions with snippets)
5. Hover documentation (rich Markdown with examples)
6. Symbol definitions (document outline structure)
7. Code lenses (reference counts, warnings)
8. Diagnostic messages (error/warning templates)
9. Effect documentation (all 79 effects with examples)
10. Trigger documentation (all 80 triggers with examples)
11. Portrait animations (251 animations from `data/animations.yaml`)

**What Stays in Python:**
- Parser (AST construction)
- Scope chain validation (complex state tracking)
- Cross-file indexing (symbol resolution)
- Navigation features (go-to-def, find refs)
- LSP protocol implementation

## 1. FULLY VALIDATED FILE TYPES (Schema-Driven)

**All file types below use declarative YAML schemas** - validation, completions, hover, symbols, and code lens are now schema-driven!

### Table 1a: Structure & Context Validation

| File Type | Location | Required Fields | Effect/Trigger Context | Scope Chains | Cross-File Refs |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Events | `events/` | ✅ `type`, `title`, `desc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ scripted, ⚠️ events |
| Letter Events | `events/` | ✅ `type`, `title`, `desc`, `sender` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ scripted, ⚠️ events |
| Event Options | `events/` | ✅ `name` (conditional) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Event triggered_desc | `events/` | ✅ `trigger`, `desc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Event Portraits | `events/` | ✅ `character` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Story Cycles | `common/story_cycles/` | ✅ `effect_group` + timing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ scripted |
| Story triggered_effect | `common/story_cycles/` | ✅ `trigger`, `effect` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Decisions | `common/decisions/` | ✅ `ai_check_interval`, `effect` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ indexed |
| Character Interactions | `common/character_interactions/` | ✅ `category` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ indexed |
| Schemes | `common/schemes/` | ✅ `skill` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ indexed |
| On Actions | `common/on_actions/` | ✅ events or `effect` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ indexed |
| Mod Descriptor | `descriptor.mod` | ✅ `name` | N/A | N/A | N/A |

> **Table 1a** shows the structural validation capabilities for each file type. This includes whether required fields are enforced (like `type` and `title` for events), whether effects are correctly placed in effect blocks and triggers in trigger blocks, whether scope chain transitions are validated (e.g., `liege.primary_title`), and whether cross-file references to scripted effects/triggers are resolved.

### Table 1b: Value & Pattern Validation

| File Type | Loc Keys | Duplicates | Value Checks | Performance | Field Order | Pattern Validation | Type Resolution | Schema |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Events | ✅ code lens | ✅ immediate, trigger_else | ✅ ai_chance | ✅ iterators | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `events.yaml` |
| Letter Events | ✅ code lens | ✅ | ✅ ai_chance | ✅ iterators | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `events.yaml` |
| Event Options | ✅ | ✅ multiple names | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `events.yaml` |
| Event triggered_desc | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `events.yaml` |
| Event Portraits | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `events.yaml` |
| Story Cycles | ✅ code lens | ✅ | ✅ chance > 100 | ✅ short intervals | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `story_cycles.yaml` |
| Story triggered_effect | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `story_cycles.yaml` |
| Decisions | ✅ code lens | ✅ | ✅ cost, cooldown | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `decisions.yaml` |
| Character Interactions | ✅ code lens | ✅ | ✅ cooldown | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `character_interactions.yaml` |
| Schemes | ✅ code lens | ✅ | ✅ power, cooldown | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `schemes.yaml` |
| On Actions | ✅ code lens | ✅ | ✅ event weights | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `on_actions.yaml` |
| Mod Descriptor | N/A | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | ❌ |

> **Table 1b** covers value-level validation and the schema file that drives each file type. This includes localization key tracking (with code lens for missing keys), duplicate block detection, numeric value range checks (like `ai_chance` values), and performance warnings for expensive operations. The Schema column indicates which YAML schema file defines the validation rules.

> **Table 2a** tracks code navigation features by file location. Go-to-Definition and Find References let you jump to and discover usages of scripted effects, triggers, events, and localization keys. Symbols provides the document outline for breadcrumb navigation. Highlight shows all occurrences of a symbol in the current file, Links makes file paths clickable, and Rename enables workspace-wide symbol renaming.

### Table 2b: Editing & Assistance Features

| File Type | Completions | Hover | Sig Help | Inlay Hints | Code Lens | Format | Fold | Schema |
|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|------|--------|
| **events/** | ✅ Schema | ✅ Schema | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Schema | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

| **localization/** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| **gui/** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

> **Table 2b** covers features that assist with writing code. Completions provides context-aware autocomplete for effects, triggers, and fields. Hover shows documentation when you mouse over keywords. Signature Help displays parameter hints. Inlay Hints shows inline scope type annotations. Code Lens displays reference counts and warnings above definitions. Format and Fold provide code formatting and collapsible regions.

**Legend:**
- ✅ Full support - file-type-aware implementation
- ✅ Schema - Schema-driven implementation (YAML-based, declarative)
- ✅ YAML - Uses YAML documentation files (effects.yaml/triggers.yaml)
- ⚠️ Partial support - generic implementation, not file-type-specific
- ❌ Not implemented

**Schema-Driven Features:**
- **Symbols**: Document outline extracted from schema definitions
- **Completions**: Field completions with snippets from schema `field_docs`
- **Hover**: Rich documentation generated from schema `field_docs`
- **Code Lens**: Reference counts and warnings configured in schema
- **Validation**: All validation rules defined declaratively in YAML



## 3. NOT YET VALIDATED FILE TYPES

**Note:** The schema-driven architecture makes it easy to add support for new file types. Creating a new schema file takes ~2 hours instead of days of Python coding.

### Table 3a: Structure & Context

| File Type | Location | Required Fields | Effect/Trigger Context | Scope Chains | Cross-File Refs |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Traits | `common/traits/` | ❌ `category` | ⚠️ generic only | ✅ | ❌ |

| Men at Arms | `common/men_at_arms_types/` | ❌ `damage`, `toughness` | ⚠️ generic only | ✅ | ❌ |

> **Table 3a** lists file types that don't yet have dedicated schema validation. These files still benefit from generic checks (effect/trigger context validation, scope chains), but lack file-type-specific required field validation. The Required Fields column shows what fields *should* be validated when a schema is created.

### Table 3b: Value Validation & Status

| File Type | Loc Keys | Duplicates | Value Checks | Performance | Priority | Schema Status |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|----------|---------------|

> **Table 3b** shows the current validation status and implementation priority for unvalidated file types. Most are marked 🔄 Planned, meaning a schema could be created. Scripted Effects/Triggers already have partial support via the effects.yaml/triggers.yaml documentation files. The Priority column indicates which file types would benefit most from dedicated schema support.

## 4. HISTORY FILES

| File Type | Location | Required Fields | Effect/Trigger Context | Scope Chains | Cross-File Refs | Loc Keys | Duplicates | Value Checks | Performance |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Character History | `history/characters/` | ❌ `name`, `dynasty` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Province History | `history/provinces/` | ❌ `culture`, `religion` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Title History | `history/titles/` | ❌ date blocks | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> **Section 4** covers history files that define the starting state of the game world. These files use a different structure than common/ files (date-based blocks rather than effect/trigger blocks) and currently have no dedicated validation. Future support could validate date formats, cross-references to characters/titles, and required fields like dynasty assignments.

## 5. OTHER FILES

| File Type | Location | Required Fields | Effect/Trigger Context | Scope Chains | Cross-File Refs | Loc Keys | Duplicates | Value Checks | Performance |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Localization | `localization/` | ❌ | N/A | N/A | ✅ indexed | N/A | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| GUI | `gui/` | ❌ | N/A | N/A | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| GFX | `gfx/` | ❌ | N/A | N/A | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |

> **Section 5** covers non-script files that support the mod. Localization files (`.yml`) are indexed so that localization key references in script files can be validated and navigated. GUI and GFX files use completely different syntax and are not validated, though file path links in scripts pointing to these locations are still clickable.

## 6. FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

> **Section 6** is organized by *Python module*—it answers "what does each source file do?" Each row in the table below represents a `.py` file in the codebase, showing what features that module provides, whether it has file-type-specific logic, and whether it uses the schema-driven architecture. This is a **developer-focused** view useful for understanding the codebase structure and finding where specific functionality is implemented.

| 40 | `log_diagnostics.py` | Log→LSP bridge: converts log results to diagnostics, path resolution, lifecycle management | ❌ N/A (bridge module) | ❌ |

#### Core Infrastructure

| # | Module | Features Provided | File Type Awareness | Schema-Driven |
|---|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 41 | `parser.py` | Lexical/AST parsing: tokenization, block/assignment/list parsing, `get_node_at_position`, memory-optimized | ❌ N/A (core parser) | ❌ (infrastructure) |
| 42 | `server.py` | LSP orchestrator: 33+ LSP features, document sync, diagnostics publishing, workspace scanning, async debouncing, thread pool | ⚠️ Generic (all files) | ❌ (routes to modules) |
| 43 | `utils.py` | Shared utilities: URI↔path conversion (Windows/Unix), position-in-range checking | ❌ N/A (utilities) | ❌ |
| 44 | `__init__.py` | Package metadata: version (`1.1.0`), docstrings, file support declarations | ❌ N/A (package init) | ❌ |

### 6.2 What "File Type Aware" Means

**✅ File Type Aware:**
- Knows the expected structure of the file type
- Validates required fields specific to that type
- Provides type-specific completions/hints
- Example: Events have `type`, `title`, `desc`; story cycles have `effect_group`

**⚠️ Generic (Block Context):**
- Works for any .txt file
- Only understands trigger vs effect block context
- Doesn't know file-type-specific field requirements
- Example: Catches effects in trigger blocks everywhere

**❌ Not Implemented:**
- No validation for this file type
- May still benefit from generic features

## 7. INDEXED SYMBOL TYPES

The `indexer.py` tracks these symbols across the workspace:

| Symbol Type | Source Location | Used For |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Events | `events/**/*.txt` | Go-to-def, find refs, validation |
| Scripted Effects | `common/scripted_effects/**/*.txt` | Go-to-def, validation, completion |
| Scripted Triggers | `common/scripted_triggers/**/*.txt` | Go-to-def, validation, completion |
| Scripted Lists | `common/scripted_lists/**/*.txt` | Validation |
| Script Values | `common/script_values/**/*.txt` | Go-to-def, validation |
| On-Actions | `common/on_actions/**/*.txt` | Reference tracking |
| Saved Scopes | Any file | Highlight, rename |
| Variables | Any file | Highlight, rename |
| Character Flags | Any file | Highlight, rename |
| Localization | `localization/**/*.yml` | Validation, go-to-def |
| Modifiers | `common/modifiers/**/*.txt` | Validation |
| Opinion Modifiers | `common/opinion_modifiers/**/*.txt` | Validation |

## 8. LEGEND

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Fully implemented with file-type-specific logic |
| ⚠️ | Partially implemented (generic checks only) |
| ❌ | Not implemented |
| N/A | Not applicable to this file type |

**"Generic checks"** (apply to all .txt files):
- Effect in trigger block detection
- Effect in any_ iterator warning
- Missing limit in random_ warning
- every_ without limit warning
- Unknown effect/trigger validation (if indexed)
- Scope chain validation (where context available)

### New Validation Feature Columns

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Field Order** | Validates fields appear in conventional order (style) | `type` before `title` before `desc` in events |
| **Pattern Validation** | Validates field values match expected patterns | Loc keys match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_.]*$`, numbers are numeric |
| **Type Resolution** | Resolves `type: localization_key` from `_types.yaml` and enforces its pattern | `type: scope_reference` → enforces scope pattern |

**Implementation Priority:**
- **Pattern Validation + Type Resolution** (recommended): Catches real bugs (invalid loc keys, bad scope refs)
- **Field Order**: Style preference only (CK3 is order-insensitive)

## 9. LSP FEATURE INVENTORY

> **Section 9** is organized by *LSP feature category*—it answers "what capabilities does this language server have?" Features are grouped into Validation (diagnostics), Navigation, and Editing Assistance, which are standard LSP capability categories. Each row describes a user-facing feature and notes which module implements it. This is a **user/capability-focused** view useful for understanding what the extension can do.

### Validation Features (Diagnostics)
| Feature | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Required Fields** | Validates mandatory fields per file type | `events.py`, `story_cycles.py` |
| **Effect/Trigger Context** | Prevents effects in trigger blocks | `paradox_checks.py` |
| **Scope Chain Validation** | Validates scope transitions | `scopes.py` |
| **Cross-File References** | Validates refs to effects/triggers/events | `indexer.py`, `diagnostics.py` |
| **Localization Keys** | Checks localization refs exist | `localization.py` |
| **Duplicate Detection** | Detects duplicate definitions | `paradox_checks.py` |
| **Value Range Checks** | Validates numeric ranges (chance, etc.) | `paradox_checks.py` |
| **Iterator Validation** | Validates any_/every_/random_ usage | `lists.py` |
| **Style Checks** | Whitespace, formatting validation | `style_checks.py` |

### Navigation Features
| Feature | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Go-to-Definition** | Jump to symbol definition | `navigation.py` |
